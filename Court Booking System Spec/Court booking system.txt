Booking system requirements
***************************

Customer/Location/Facility/Courts structure

i.e. 
1 customer
Multiple locations
Multiple facilities per location (e.g. squash, tennis)
Multiple courts per facility

===========================

Licensing structure

Customer licence - unlimited usage
Per location licence - 1 location unlimited facilities

===========================

Membership

Should be separate database so a member only needs to register once but can be linked to multiple customers

Name

Customer Id and member Id - so a member can be linked to multiple customers
Unique member Id
Email address
Active member (i.e. have they paid up).  If inactive then cannot book.

Members are linked to locations
They are then linked to facilities they are allowed to use at those locations

===========================

Tracking/Booking

Track missed bookings - optional.  Needs to be managed by administrator in case they want to clear a members missed bookings
Scanning might need to be optional as they may not want the scanner.


===========================

How it works

Website
-------

Member registers on website having been sent their member Id.
Select location then facility to book, also select date and time at same time - check they can book courts i.e. have they missed any bookings
If available go to a confirmation screen.  If confirm then email confirmation QR code to them and also a confirmation number incase they don't have their phone to scan when they turn up.

Need to be able to cancel a booking

At the club
-----------

Touch screen with 2 options:

1) Book a court
2) Turn up for a booking

Banner for club notices?

Book a court shows the booking sheet as if they were going through the booking folder.  Can book by scanning "membership QR code" which is part of the phone app?

Play asks them to scan the QR code or enter booking reference to acknowledge they have turned up for that court.  Scanning will look up member Id bookings for that customer Id and location Id.

Should it work offline?

Fun things
----------

Record your score - when you make a booking you can link it to your opponent and then put the score in if you want to.
